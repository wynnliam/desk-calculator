# Desk Calcualtor

This is a simple desk calculator. You can perform
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and
negation on floatin point values.

## How do I run this?
You need the following packages:

* `make`
* `flex`
* 'bison`

How you install these depends on your OS, but if you use arch,
it would be:

`sudo pacman -Syu flex bison make`

Then, once you have these packages, you just run:

`make`

Then

`./a.out`

## What makes this interesting?

Nothing really, but it's an edifying demo of both the lex
lexical analyzer and yacc syntax analyer.
